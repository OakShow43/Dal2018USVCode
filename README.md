# Dal2018USVCode
Code for ECED4900 Senior Year project that contains code for the communication between bluetooth controller and raspberry pi. 
I will be using Python to write a script that takes certain commands from an 8bitdo bluetooth controller and creates a control
command string that will be sent over USB to an RF radio to a USV to control in motion.
